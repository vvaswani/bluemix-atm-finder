# ATM Finder

This is a simple mobile app to find the nearest ATM. It's built with Bootstrap, jQuery, and the Google Places API.

## Getting Started

* Update the API key in the scripts with your own API key. 

## Google API Access
* To use the Google Places API, you need an API key. You can get one for free at [https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/). The [article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-find-atm-app/index.html) provides details and screenshots for the process.
* Once you have the API key, add it near the beginning of the index.php and index-js.php script, replacing the current placeholder text.
